this mod is stupid idk why i thought i could to it

i cancelled this mod because i dont have the experience in all of the requirements to make a mod, i dont have money to commission stuff, and i dont know how to use haxeflixel..

i made the source code public so you guys can make your mod using the engine but i dont recommend it because its somewhat unstable at points... 

there may be some stuff i didnt remove in the code but i dont care at this point. another friday night funkin versus mod is dead.

please dont play this.

so this engine is being remade in unity now so uncancelled (i think)
